## Comet
A RISC-V 32-bit processor written in C++ for High Level Synthesis (HLS).
Support for the RV32I base ISA only, support for the M extension can be found on another branch. There is branch dedicated to the support of the F extension but it is not stable yet and may not be in a functional state.
